# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Install development dependencies
uv sync --extra dev
```

### Code Style

This project uses `ruff` for code formatting and linting:

# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Check for linting issues
uv run ruff check .

# Auto-fix linting issues
uv run ruff check --fix .
```

### Common Issues

1. **"No data available"**: Ensure your CSV file has the required columns
2. **Import errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed with `uv sync`
3. **Performance issues**: Try filtering data by date range for large datasets
